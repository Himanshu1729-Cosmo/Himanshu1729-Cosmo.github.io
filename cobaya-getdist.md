# Post-processing and Visualization
---

Once the MCMC sampling with Cobaya is completed, the output consists of several files generated using the chosen run name (e.g., `test`). These typically include:

`test.1.txt`, `test.checkpoint`, `test.covmat`, `test.input.yaml`, `test.progress`, and `test.updated.yaml`.

Each file serves a specific purpose:

- `.1.txt` → Main MCMC chain file containing sampled parameter values  
- `.covmat` → Covariance matrix used for proposal updates  
- `.progress` → Information about convergence and sampling status  
- `.input.yaml` / `.updated.yaml` → Configuration files for the run  
- `.checkpoint` → Allows restarting the chain if interrupted  

For post-processing and plotting, the most important file is:

`test.1.txt`

This file contains the actual MCMC samples. Inside, you will find multiple columns corresponding to different cosmological parameters (e.g., $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, etc.), along with additional columns such as weights and likelihood values.

Now, we introduce the main library used for post-processing, namely the **GetDist** package, which is widely used in cosmology. It provides a powerful and flexible framework for processing Monte Carlo chains, computing marginalized constraints, and generating high-quality plots such as one-dimensional distributions and two-dimensional contour (triangle) plots.

GetDist is fully compatible with Cobaya outputs and allows efficient handling of large datasets. It also supports derived parameters, parameter transformations, and comparison between different cosmological models or datasets.

In this section, we will demonstrate how to load Cobaya chain files, analyze them using GetDist, and produce standard cosmological plots.
